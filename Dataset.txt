This project uses three widely-recognized spontaneous micro-expression datasets:

SAMM

CASME II

SMIC

These datasets are not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. You can obtain them directly from the respective authors or institutions as cited in their original research papers.

Once obtained, the datasets can be combined into a unified static image dataset using the method proposed in the MGC209 (MGRC sub-challenge) approach. This process standardizes the frame format, labels, and file structure to enable unified training across datasets.

For details on dataset preparation and alignment, please refer to the MGC209 official guidelines or replication instructions.
